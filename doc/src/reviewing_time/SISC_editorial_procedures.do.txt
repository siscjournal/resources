#TITLE: Speeding Up The Review Process: SISC Editorial Policies and Procedures
#DATE: today

This document contains an update on editorial policies from SIAM
for reducing the reviewing time of papers. The various types of
reminder emails and services that SISC has implemented are
thereafter described.


===== SIAM Polices (2012) =====

In 2012, SIAM attempted to implement many of the suggestions in a
report by Nick Trefethen on how to shorten the average time from
submission to acceptance of papers (an update to the original report
appeared as a "SIAM News article":
"../../src/reviewing_time/Nick_Trefethen_SIAMNews_april12.pdf").  The
new suggested SIAM policies, also adopted by SISC, are summarized
below.

 o Editors are encouraged to turn around manuscripts promptly.  In
   particular, they should assign referees as quickly as possible, and
   are reminded that it is entirely appropriate to reject obviously weak
   manuscripts without sending them to referees.  It is also often
   appropriate to make decisions based on two contradictory reports if
   the editor has sufficient information.

 o SIAM's journals depend on the work of thousands of volunteer
   referees.  Words like "deadline" and "overdue" should never be used in
   making requests of such volunteers.  Gentler expressions like "target
   date" are preferred instead.

 o By default, referees seeing a manuscript for the first time should
   normally be asked to respond within at most 2 months, except in the
   case of Survey and Review manuscripts for SIAM Review.  Editors are
   free to make exceptions for individual manuscripts, and referees are
   free to request extensions.

 o Shorter response times should be requested when papers that have
   undergone minor revision are sent to referees for a second or third
   time.  Some minor revisions can be approved by editors without sending
   back to referees.

 o By default, authors should normally be asked to produce minor
   revisions within at most 1 month, and major revisions within at most 2
   months. Extensions will be readily granted if they wish to take
   longer.  Unrevised manuscripts won't be removed from the system until
   many months later, but we should encourage more rapid action in all
   phases of the process.

 o SIAM will investigate the ongoing development of systems that might
   be put in place so that editors and possibly referees are reminded
   automatically of approaching and passed target dates, always employing
   reasonable language (item #2).  The details will depend on
   what is technically feasible and will be worked out by the SIAM office
   in consultation with Editors-in-Chief.

 o SIAM's aim is that the average interval between submission of a
   manuscript and final acceptance for publication should be no longer
   than about 8 months.


===== Summary of SISC's Reminder Emails =====
label{reminders}

Regarding item 6 above, SISC has been proactive about implementing
various types of reminders to reduce delays:

 * There is a reminder to the AE if the referees are not assigned after
   7 days.

 * There is an autogenerated reminder to the AE when a referee has not
   responded after 7 days.

 * There is an autogenerated reminder to the AE if the referee report
   is not in at the day after the due date. A repeated reminder to the
   AE is sent three weeks later if the report is still missing.

 * The AE is notified in email when all reports are in and a decision
   can be made.

 * Brittni sends an email to the AE 14 days after the last referee report
   arrived in case no decision has yet been made.

 * Every two months, Brittni sends each AE a status report with an
   overview of all the papers the AE is responsible for in the web
   system (this report was sent every three months in the past).

 * Karen St√∏verud identifies delayed manuscripts and sends personal
   emails to the relevant AEs about four times a year.


===== Desired Time Schedules for Paper Handling =====

The desired time periods for various actions are implicit in the first
five points above. Our aim is to have potential referees assigned
within one week and then have acceptance from the referee within another
week. Referees should be reminded when the target date for the review
has passed, and a decision should be made at most two weeks after the
last report has arrived. Very often, decisions can be made quickly
after all reports are in. We know, of course, that there are many
natural exceptions to this ideal scheme in the real world. However, we
hope reminders can help all of us to reduce unnecessary delays in
the handling of SISC papers.

There is one circumstance in which we ask all AEs to always respond
quickly, and that is when authors write back about referee reports and
decisions. Even though more time may be necessary to respond properly
to the inquiry, please make sure to confirm receipt of the email
and indicate when you will come back with a more complete answer. Do
not hesitate to contact me or the section editors if you need to
discuss feedback from authors and the possibility for resubmission.


===== Chaser Emails =====

All follow-up measures and autogenerated reminders described above are
with regard to AEs only. The way in which referees are reminded is up
to each AE, but using the chaser emails in the web system is strongly
recommended, as this simplifies the task of tracking paper
handling. In general, we recommend communication with authors,
referees, section editors, or myself through the web system (click on
"Send Manuscript Correspondence" under the heading "More Manuscript
Info and Tools" in the manuscript main page).

Sometimes the target date of a review is adjusted as a result of
communication between the AE and the referee. Since the reminders to
the AEs about missing referee reports are generated based on the
recorded due date in the web system, it is important to adjust this
date accordingly. Under the "Advanced Manuscript Tasks" heading at the
bottom of the manuscript main page, you can click on "Extend Review
Deadline" and fill in the number of days from "Review Start Date".
The system is not capable of reading absolute dates; only time
intervals are possible. Knowing well that even scientific computing
experts might struggle with "date plus days" calculations, I have
included some help at the end of this email. You can also ask Brittni
(email sisc@siam.org) to a referee's due date on your behalf.

Let me remind you that the journal's communication with authors and
referees is performed by the AE; however, the SE or the
Editor-in-Chief can take over such communication whenever the AE
wants it.

SISC's long-serving editor Margaret Wright previously brought
attention to the wording of chaser letters to referees: such letters
should be phrased in a very positive tone and avoid demands to deliver
the report as well as absolute words such as "deadline".  Her comment
resulted in item 2 in the new SIAM guidelines above. And as Nick says
in his SIAM News article, "We are relying on expert labor contributed
gratis by busy colleagues".  Please have this in mind when writing
chaser emails.


===== Personal Email Templates =====

Different AEs and different referees represent different cultures. We
therefore strongly recommend that you edit the default SIAM/SISC
chaser template the way you desire, and that you adapt the template
to the referee in question. As an example, my personal templates start
with an appreciation of the willingness to referee before asking, in a
soft tone, when she or he expects the report to be ready. In the
exceptional cases when collecting a report proves really difficult, it
can sometimes be effective to send friendly reminders weekly.

To edit the template emails, find the heading "General Tasks" on the
editor's main page, and choose "Individual Preferences: My Email
Templates". Any of the template letters can now be edited by clicking
on "edit".

One important point: for those of you who have already customized the
templates for minor and major revisions, notice that we now want the
author to submit the revised manuscript within one and two months,
respectively. Please find your templates and make the corresponding
edits! All journal-wide default templates have been updated by SIAM,
but your personal versions of minor and major revision decision letters
will override the journal-wide template.


===== Rejection Letters =====

Template letters can be sufficient in many cases, but rejection
letters normally deserve an edit and extension of the template.
Unless all the referee reports are very clear about the reasons for
rejection, the editor should briefly explain the background for the
decision. Quite often there is a positive and a negative report, and
since acceptance in the end requires two positive reports, the editor
must judge whether it is likely possible to revise the manuscript in a
way that the opinion of the negative referee can be changed. Also,
remember that we always attach all available reports, positive or
negative, to the rejection letter. The exception occurs only when a
report does not meet a reasonable scientific standard.

As we speak of rejection, the first point in the SIAM/SISC policy
above says that "it is entirely appropriate to reject obviously weak
manuscripts without sending them to referees". Therefore, I encourage
all of you to invest some effort in assessing manuscripts where you
spot weak elements, and see if early rejection is a good choice. It is
much better for the authors to get the paper quickly back and then
consider other journals or perform substantial changes than to wait
several months for a decision that most likely will be
negative.  A good portion of the incoming submissions to SISC are
immediately rejected, either by the SEs or me. However, an AE often
has expert competence on the topic that may uncover major weaknesses
we have not seen.

===== Appendix: Date + Days =====

To calculate the due date for an extended review period of 90 days,
starting on July 15, 2012, you can write in MATLAB:

!bc mcod
datestr(datenum('15-July-2012')+90)
!ec

The corresponding Python statements are:

!bc pycod
import datetime as d
print d.date(2012, 07, 15) + d.timedelta(90)
!ec
