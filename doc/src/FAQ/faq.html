<P>
<B>Q:</B> How will I know when I have been assigned by the Editor-in-Chief or a Section Editor to serve as Associate Editor for a new paper?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> You will receive e-mail notification. The "View" link in the e-mail will take you to the page where you can access the cover letter, the article, and submit your decision.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> How do I send e-mail to the Editor-in-Chief or a Section Editor?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Use the "Send Manuscript Correspondence" link and type the EIC's e-mail address or Section Editor's e-mail address on the additional recipient's line. At some stages of review, "Send Manuscript Correspondence" will offer a check-box for the EIC's or SE's e-mail address. This is for convenience only. You can always type an e-mail address in when using "Send Manuscript Correspondence," like any other e-mail software.

<U><B>Referees</B></U>
<P>
<B>Q:</B> What is the process for assigning referees?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Click the link that reads Assign/Contact Potential Referees.
The page that opens offers 7 tabs:
<P>
--Search<br>
--Search Results<br>
--Add Referee<br>
--Current Referees<br>
--Referee Decline Feedback<br>
--Manuscript Details<br>
--Manuscript Files
<P>
Please search for the referee before you use the Add Referee tab. This is important, and helps preserve database integrity. If the referee you seek shows up on search, check the Select box and click Assign.
<P>
This takes you to the Current Referees screen. You will see a link "Send Request" for each referee. Click Send Request and a fully editable template email appears on your screen. Edit as you wish to personalize the message--or delete the text and paste in your own words 100%--before clicking the Send button at the bottom of the page.


<P>
<B>Q:</B> I want to use more then 2 referees, but the system won't let me contact more than 2. What do I do?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Select the tab for the Current Referees page. Above the referee names is a drop-down box where you can change the "Number of referees to secure."
The default number of referees is 2. You can change it to any number you wish, of course.
<P>
<B>Q:</B> How can I see the history of the referees who have accepted and declined?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> You can view this information via the Current Referees tab/page. If a referee has accepted or declined your invitation the Status/Contact column will indicate that, along with the date of accepted/declined.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> Will I get other notice that a referee has accepted or declined?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> You will receive e-mail notification. That e-mail will include the name of the paper, the paper's author, and the name of the referee who accepted/or the hoped-for referees who declined. An added feature prompts any potential referee who declines to suggest alternate potential referees. You will be able to see these suggestions on the Assign/Contact Referees page by clicking the Referee Decline Feedback tab.

<U><B>Assign Potential Referees</B></U>
<P>
<B>Q:</B>  Do the numbers listed in the search results (i.e., the number of pending reviews) count all SIAM journals or just SISC?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> All SIAM journals.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> Can I use wildcards in the search for names?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes - the * character is a wildcard. A search on *mara* will turn up anyone who has those letters anywhere in any name (first, last, etc.).

<P>
<B>Q:</B> I can't find "De Moor" (or any other multi-word last name) --- what should I do?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Try searching on just the second part of the name - i.e., do a search on "Moor". Or try a wildcard search on "Moor" which will pick up "De Moor" as well as "DeMoor."


<P>
<B>Q:</B> Several names appeared in my search, and I can't tell which is the correct one. What do I do?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Each name returned on the Search Results screen displays as a link. Click each name in turn to see Contact Information on that individual to aid in your decision.


<P>
<B>Q:</B> The e-mail address for the referee I want to use is incorrect - what do I do?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Enter the correct e-mail address on the To: line of your message. This, however, is a one-time-only change for that single message. To request a change to SIAM's database of addresses, e-mail Brittni Holland at <A HREF="mailto:sisc@siam.org">sisc@siam.org.</A>

<P>
<B>Q:</B> The person I want to assign as a potential referee is not listed in the system. What should I do?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Click on the Add Referee tab and enter that person's information manually. This should only be done as a last resort as it has the potential to create a duplicate entry in the database.

<BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<U><B>Contact Potential Referees</B></U>
<P>
<B>Q:</B> Will I always have a chance to edit the e-mail after I click Send Request on the Current Referees screen? <BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> How do I remove a potential referee?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> There is a “Remove” box on the left-hand side of the Current Referees screen. After you check-mark that box click the Apply Changes button. Once you send your e-mail request asking the potential referee to review the paper, the “Remove” option disappears. If you later need to remove a referee name contact SIAM staff.
<P>
<B>Q:</B> Can I save an e-mail message to a referee that I've edited for my own use?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes. On your home page click "Individual Preferences: My Email Templates." On the page that follows you'll find 8 letters under the heading Letters to Referees. To change any or all click the Edit link. Substitute your own text and save. Your own version now replaces the original. Should you ever want to return to the journal default version click the Remove link.

<U><B>Chase Referees</B></U>
<P>
<B>Q:</B> Will I have a chance to edit the e-mail before it is sent?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> Will I get reminders when it is time to prompt referees?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> No.


<P>
<B>Q:</B> How are the chase dates calculated?
<BR>
<B>A:</B>  SISC's system sets 60 days from the time a referee accepts your invitation until the report due date arrives. The due date is deemed the initial "chase" date. The next prompt date is 2 weeks later. Then 2 more weeks after each prompting. However, these dates are not binding--the system sends no referee prompts automatically--and you may send prompts at any time. Red arrows pointing to "Chase referee" links will alert you that the system has calculated that you may want to consider re-contacting the referee at this time.

<P>
<U><B>Referee Reports</B></U>


<P>
<B>Q:</B> Can I see the page that a referee uses to submit his or her decision?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Not directly, unless you name yourself as one of the referees, or are serving as a referee for a different paper.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> Am I notified when the referee reports are received?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes. You receive an e-mail.


<P>
<B>Q:</B> Can a referee revise his or her report once it is submitted?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> No. The only option is for the referee to send his or her revised report directly to you.


<P>
<B>Q:</B> Can a referee see his or her report once it is submitted?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> A referee, after logging in to the system, can use the homepage link Completed Reviews to access a report sent in the past. A referee can also obtain a review he or she filed in the past by contacting SIAM staff.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> Should I check referee reports for inadvertent identity disclosure?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> This is strongly encouraged, as PDF and Word file attachments sometimes contain hidden information that reveal referee identity. If the referee sends his or her report as an attached file be sure to check and edit it. See <A HREF="http://www.siam.org/journals/identity.php" target="_blank">http://www.siam.org/journals/identity.php</A> for information on finding and removing identity clues in referee reports.

<P>
<U><B>Supplementary Materials</B></U>
<P>
<B>Q:</B> Does SISC consider Supplementary Materials for publication?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes. Authors are encouraged to submit Supplementary Materials to complement articles. They might include additional figures or examples, animations, data sets used in the paper, computer code used to generate figures or tables, or other materials that are necessary to fully document the research contained in the paper or to facilitate the readers' ability to understand and extend the work.
<P>
Supplementary Materials are generally not refereed but are available to you as the Review Editor, and to the referees. The referees are asked to give the materials at least a cursory look and verify that they are appropriate to accompany the article. They may suggest changes, including removing some extraneous Supplementary Materials or moving items from the main text to the Supplementary Materials.
<P>
The author is also asked to submit an index of the Supplementary Materials. You should find a listing of each item along with a brief description and a justification for why the item should be included.  This should be helpful in in judging the appropriateness of the materials.
<P>
Full guidelines on the journal's Supplementary Materials policy are available at <a href="http://www.siam.org/journals/sisc/supplementary.php" target="_blank">http://www.siam.org/journals/sisc/supplementary.php</a>.

<U><B>Editorial Decision</B></U>
<P>
<B>Q:</B> Am I notified by e-mail when a paper is ready for decision?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> When I try to print the reports, they are too wide. How can I get a printer friendly version?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> From the main page of the manuscript, the "Referees" link is highlighted. Click that to see the referee reports, then choose the "Printer Friendly Version."

<P>
<B>Q:</B> On the page titled "Associate Editor's Overall Assessment," what happens when I click the "View and complete your decision letter" button? Is e-mail sent at that point?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> No e-mail is sent out. You will be taken to a 2nd page where you have the opportunity to review and edit the e-mail and add attachments. See the note above the View and complete your decision letter button. It reads:
<P>
<B><U><font color=#FF0000>Editors please note:</font></U></B> Click the button below to proceed to your 2nd decision page. On the next page you will see your decision letter as the author will, complete with referee reports, if any.
The 2nd page is an editing screen, and you will be able to modify your own letter and edit referee comments. If referees sent reports via file attachments it is on the following page that you'll be able to download, edit if necessary, and re-attach the referee report files.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> On the 2nd page where the e-mail is edited, is my information saved if I hit cancel?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes and no. The "Overall Rating" and "Remarks to Author" you entered on the first page are saved; however, the choice of whether or not to send the text comments from the referees and the type of "Template Letter" are not saved. To save everything and return later click "Save Draft." If you are finished click "Send Decision to Author."

<P>
<B>Q:</B>Can I edit the journal-wide template decision letters? Can I create my own decision letters?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes on both counts. On your home page click "Individual Preferences: My Email Templates." On the page that follows you'll find all of the journal template decision letters. Click the Edit link to change any or all. Substitute your own text and save. Your own version now replaces the original. Should you ever want to return to the journal default version click the Remove link. You can also create totally new decision letters for your use alone; they will be seen only by you. Click the link "Create new decision letter template." Follow the instructions on the new page that opens.

<U><B>Send Manuscript Correspondence</B></U>

<P>
<B>Q:</B> What is the different between using this option and sending e-mail directly?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> All e-mail sent using this option is archived.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> How do I get to this option?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> From your home page (i.e., the page that lists all the articles for which you are responsible), choose a manuscript. Scroll down to the option "Send Manuscript Correspondence."

<P>
<B>Q:</B> To whom can I send correspondence with this option?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> Anyone, as long as you type the e-mail address in yourself (as with most e-mail software). There are for-your-convenience checkboxes provided, but the checkboxes available depend on the current stage of the paper. For most of the time the paper is in review you have checkboxes offering the option to send e-mail to yourself, the journal staff, the corresponding author, the Editor-in-Chief, and the referees.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> If I use this option and send a copy of a message to myself I see that an embedded link appears at the end of the e-mail. This link allows me to log into the system directly, without typing in my username and password. Do other recipients of the same correspondence receive this embedded link? Can they access my account?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> No. Security is intact. An e-mail sent to multiple recipients through
Send Manuscript Correspondence generates a separate and individual e-mail to each recipient. An author or referee's copy will not match the copy you send to yourself. The embedded URL that appears at the end of the message is always
specific to the recipient, and to their role. Example: The link in the e-mail that the  author receives will enable the author to access the system as himself or herself (the same as if they logged in with their username and password), and with no special privileges. Confidentiality and security are not compromised. The embedded links--whether in Send Manuscript Correspondence or in other system-generated e-mail--are always user-specific.
<BR>
<B>NOTE:</B> Never copy and paste such a link from your own e-mail into a message that you intend to forward to someone else. To do so is the same as
e-mailing another individual your password.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> How do I see the archive of manuscript correspondence?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> You can only see the correspondence once you have accepted the assignment to serve as Review Editor. From your home page choose a manuscript. If you scroll down, you will see the option to "View E-mail." To view a particular message, click on the subject line. It will open in a separate window.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> How do I resend an e-mail that was previously sent?
<BR>
<B>A:</B> This is an option in the "View E-mail" pane. Note that as soon as you click "Resend E-mail" it will be sent --- there is no option for editing.
